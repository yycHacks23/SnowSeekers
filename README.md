DESCRIPTION:
This project was created to provide a centralized platform for tourists and residents of Calgary to access information about winter events in the city, making it easier for visitors to plan their winter holiday and access the information they need. We believe that by addressing the challenge of accessible information, we can help bring the magic of a Canadian winter to life for everyone who visits Calgary.

In order to find the best solution for the problem of unorganized and inaccessible information for tourists in Calgary, we conducted research on cities with similar problems and how they resolved them. One city we reached out to was Seattle. By reaching out we learned that Seattle also faced the same challenge of disjointed information for tourists. However, they were able to overcome this through the creation of "visitseattle.org" - among other things, a centralized platform that provided all the information a tourist needed to know about the city and its events.  We followed this model and catered it specifically for Calgarian winter.

Moving forward we would work with the city of calgary to build datasets with more detailed information on events and activities going on in the city during the winter because there is a lack of data to serve the purpose of a web app like this.
